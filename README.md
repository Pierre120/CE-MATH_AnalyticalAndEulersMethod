# CE-MATH_AnalyticalAndEulersMethod
CE-MATH Machine Project 2. This implements both the Analytical Method and Euler's Method in solving the fixed differential equation. It first asks the user for an inital value for `x` and `y`, upper and lower limits, and the interval or step size to initialize the equations.
